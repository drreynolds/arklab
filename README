ARKLab provides a suite of Matlab files that implement adaptive-step
explicit, implicit and additive Runge-Kutta methods.  This software is 
designed for instructional use and has been implemented to be easily 
understood and modified.  As a result, certain efficiency-related 
optimizations have been omitted.

We currently provide three classes of methods:
(a) explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK), 
(b) diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK), and
(c) additive Runge-Kutta (ARK).

In addition to these three classes of methods, we provide a large
number of Butcher tables (over 70), holding the coefficients for
existing methods in each of these three categories.

For these methods, time step adaptivity is enabled for methods
with embeddings.  All three classes of methods may be run in so-called
"fixed-step mode", wherein the solver will take steps of a
user-supplied magnitude.  This mode is currently required for all
methods without embeddings.

In addition to these sets of solvers, we provide a set of simple
example problems that may be used to test different methods, and that
may be used as a template for creating new problems.  These test problems
are described in the accompanying file, 'Problems.txt'.
